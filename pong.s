; First, we'll start by defining some data structures that we'll use to store information about the game state. 

struct Vector2
{
    float x;
    float y;
};

struct Player
{
    struct Vector2 position;
    struct Vector2 velocity;
    int score;
};

struct Ball
{
    struct Vector2 position;
    struct Vector2 velocity;
};

struct GameState
{
    struct Player player1;
    struct Player player2;
    struct Ball ball;
};

; Next, we'll define some global variables to hold the current game state and the frame buffer that we'll use to draw the game on the screen.
section .bss
    game_state: resb sizeof(struct GameState)
    frame_buffer: resb 800 * 600 * 4
    
; Now we can start defining the functions that make up the game. We'll start with the Update function, which will be responsible for updating the game state each frame.

Update:
    ; update player 1 position
    movq game_state, rax
    movq [rax + offsetof(struct GameState, player1)], rax
    movss [rax + offsetof(struct Player, position.x)], xmm0
    movss [rax + offsetof(struct Player, position.y)], xmm1

    ; update player 2 position
    movq game_state, rax
    movq [rax + offsetof(struct GameState, player2)], rax
    movss [rax + offsetof(struct Player, position.x)], xmm2
    movss [rax + offsetof(struct Player, position.y)], xmm3

    ; update ball position
    movq game_state, rax
    movq [rax + offsetof(struct GameState, ball)], rax
    movss [rax + offsetof(struct Ball, position.x)], xmm4
    movss [rax + offsetof(struct Ball, position.y)], xmm5

    ret
; Next, we'll define the Render function, which will be responsible for drawing the game state to the frame buffer.

Render:
    ; clear frame buffer
    xor ecx, ecx
    mov edi, frame_buffer
    mov eax, 800 * 600 * 4
    rep stosb

    ; draw player 1
    movq game_state, rax
    movq [rax + offsetof(struct GameState, player1)], rax
    movss xmm0, [rax + offsetof(struct Player, position.x)]
    movss xmm1, [rax + offsetof(struct Player, position.y)]
    call DrawRectangle

    ; draw player 2
    movq game_state, rax
    movq [rax + offsetof(struct GameState, player2)], rax
    movss xmm0, [rax + offsetof(struct Player, position.x)]
    movss xmm1, [rax + offsetof(struct Player, position.y)]
    call DrawRectangle

    ; draw ball
    movq game_state, rax
    movq [rax + offsetof(struct GameState, ball)], rax
    movss xmm0, [rax + offsetof(struct Ball, position.x)]
    movss xmm1, [rax + offsetof(struct Ball, position.y)]
    call DrawCircle

    ; draw score
    movq game_state, rax
    movq [rax + offsetof(struct GameState, player1)], rax
    mov eax, [rax + offsetof(struct Player, score)]
    call DrawText

    movq game_state, rax
    movq [rax + offsetof(struct GameState, player2)], rax
    mov eax, [rax + offsetof(struct Player, score)]
    call DrawText

    ret

; This function will be responsible for initializing the game state, running the game loop, and cleaning up when the game is over.

section .text

global main

main:
    ; initialize game state
    movq game_state, rax
    call InitGameState

    ; run game loop
    .game_loop:
        ; update game state
        call Update

        ; render frame
        call Render

        ; check for game over
        call CheckGameOver
        jz .game_loop

    ; clean up and exit
    call CleanUp
    xor eax, eax
